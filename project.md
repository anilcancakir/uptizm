# Uptizm

> Deep uptime monitoring that goes beyond status codes.

Uptizm is an advanced uptime monitoring platform for developers and DevOps teams. Instead of just checking for HTTP 200 OK, Uptizm parses HTML and JSON response bodies to track deep health metrics — like database connections, queue sizes, and disk usage — directly from your dashboard.

## Problem

Traditional uptime monitors only tell you if a service is "up" or "down." But a 200 OK response can hide critical issues: a database running out of connections, a message queue backing up, or disk space running low. Teams discover these problems too late, after they've already caused outages.

**Who experiences it**: Developers and DevOps engineers responsible for service reliability.
**Impact**: Silent degradation leads to unexpected outages, lost revenue, and firefighting instead of building.

## Solution

For developers and DevOps teams who need visibility beyond basic uptime checks, Uptizm is a monitoring platform that extracts and tracks deep health metrics from response bodies. Unlike Pingdom or UptimeRobot, Uptizm parses your actual application output to surface the metrics that matter before they become incidents.

## Core Features
